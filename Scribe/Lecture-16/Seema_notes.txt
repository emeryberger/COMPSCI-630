RAID and Disks
Disks are technically referred to as spinning media where as flash is not the rotating media.
Types of NVRAM technology:
1. SSD or Flash
2. PCM – Phase Change Memory
3. DVD/CD

SSD (Solid State Disks )
Flash or SSD are not having the rotating medium, they have random access and have a non volatile RAM (NVRAM).
SSD’s have chunks of RAM, you apply voltage to them.  RAM has a clock rate, new information is sent to it every clock tick, if new information isn't sent then the memory is lost. We need to refresh RAM periodically.

PCM – Phase Change Memory
Here the state depends on the crystals. Heat causes crystal to change state. Heat it, it stays in the state until you heat it again.

DVD/ CD
- DVD is optical which is supposedly slow. Its less dense and an inexpensive disk. 
- Velocity is around 1000 times less than the magnetic media.

Magnetic media has two sides and are usually vacuum – sealed.  If vacuum seal is broken, disk is dead. But vacuum seal is very sensitive, even if there were dust particles on them, it was impossible to read data. Magnetic has very bandwidth, it speed goes upto 10,000 RPM. When things are rotating very fast, we are able to read lot of data from the disk. But the drawback is magnetic media have high latency when compared to NVRAM.

Why did Google move from magnetic disks to SSD’s?
- Power savings
  Rotator consumes a lot of power
  Hard drive – 10W 
  SSD 	- mW
  
- Predictable wear
  Flash has higher life cycle, since it is being used in a dense way.
  Flash goes for load leveling:	
  -	Flash maintains another level of indirection, maintains bad blocks.
  -	It keeps a check of what has been written maximum number of times. Thus spreads the writes throughout the disk.

- Data access speed

- No need of a fan 
  Since no heat is dissipitated by SSD

- Less use of man power.
  Since SSD is more reliable. It has no moving parts and hence more reliability. No need of frequently replacing disks, hence less number of people to replace disks.

- Only drawback is SSD’s are expensive.
  Cost is around 4 times that of magnetic disks.

A hard drive is a stack of spinning discs, each of which has concentric rings of bits. The magnetic disk arm moves disk head back and forth to access data. The disk head should move really fast to access data. Thus magnetic disk head builds up speed and also has to reduce latency to land to a particular place. This is known as seek latency. This slows down random access. Random access is also slowed by waiting for the disk to spin around also known as rotation latency. To reduce this latency, we need a contiguous layout. Defragmentation helps in maintaining this contiguous layout. In case of NTFS, there is no defragmentation. Hence there was a compaction overhead when the disk was completely full. Best possible thing was to copy data from one disk to the other. But this again employs copying overhead. Thus we go for terabyte hard drive. It’s difficult to fill terabyte hard drives, thus easier to compact and hence easier to have a contiguous layout.

Why Burn – In?
The failure rate is high initially, then it reduces and rises up again. It follows a “bathtub graph”. This is the case, since products are shipped late and customers do not notice them earlier, but later they do.
Replacing bad blocks may eventually result in bad blocks table map being completely full and no contiguous layout.  If we go in for burn-in, the bad blocks table can be prevented from being full.

SCSI drives have a hardware cache, which has good performance, it fills up the cache and disks work at the back end, data is written to the disk contiguously.  If disk drive fails before a cache write, no data is written to the drive, it results in “lost blocks”.

Old file systems only bothered about performance, but reliability has recently been focused. Thus modern file systems have introduced the concept of journaling

Journaling.
In case of journaling, we keep a log of all the actions completed. If case of a power failure in between, the disk might be corrupted. In this case, we check the last entry in the log. If it is not the end of a complete action, we undo all the changes written in log to the beginning of the action.
Journal can also be corrupted since it is stored on disk. To protect journals, one should go for replicating journals.
Proof of replication through Probability:
- P(disk write fails) = p
- P(disk write succeeds) = 1-p

- P(disk write fails for two disks) = p * p = p^2
- P(disk writes succeeds for two disks) = 1- p^2
Hence, more the number of disks, success rate if higher. Here the assumption is that all the disks are independent of each other.

RAID which used to mean "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks," now means "Redundant Array of Independent Disks".  For fault tolerance, disks should be independent.
RAID has two purposes:
- Performance
- Reliability

These are achieved by
- Mirroring (RAID 0) – same data being replicated on multiple blocks
  Best reliability/ worst performance/cost
  
- Striping (RAID 1) -  different blocks have different data
  Best performance /cost worst reliability

In case of 3 disks, success rate would be as follows :
- Mirroring 
  Success rate = 1-p^3
- Striping
  Success rate = (1-p)^3

Hence optimal solution is to combine both mirroring and striping. And the only way to recover from failures is to make “BACKUPS”.
